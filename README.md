# SegformerForSemanticSegmentation
  
  
Segformer is a deep learning model architecture for image segmentation tasks. It combines two popular architectures : Transformers and U-Nets. Transformers, which were originally developed for natural language processing tasks, have recently been adapted for image analysis, and are particularly well-suited to capturing long-range dependencies within images. U-Nets, on the other hand, are commonly used for image segmentation tasks, and are known for their ability to capture fine-grained details.
